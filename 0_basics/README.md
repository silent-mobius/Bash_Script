## Compound commands overview

### Grouping

{ …; }  command grouping

( … )   command grouping in a subshell

### Conditionals

[[ ... ]]   conditional expression
if …; then …; fi    conditional branching
case … esac pattern-based branching

### Loops

for word in …; do …; done   `classic for-loop`

for ((x=1; x<=10; x++)); do ...; done   `C-style for-loop`

while …; do …; done     `while loop`

until …; do …; done     `until loop`

### Misc
